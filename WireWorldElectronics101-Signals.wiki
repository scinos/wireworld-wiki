Until now, we have talked about single electrons. An electron always is two cells in size, one for the electron-head and another one for the electron-tail. Using [[WireWorldElectronics101-WiresAndJunctions|wires]], we can transport a stream of electrons from one point to another, and the wires and well designed gates will preserve the electrons pattern.

An electron represents a binary 1, and a lack of electron (i.e. an empty space in the electrons stream) represents a binary 0. In order to effectively transport data, electrons and "gaps" must have the same size. For example, if we want to send the binary number 11101 using a fixed size //m//, we whole pattern will be 5 (number of digits) times //m// cells. Each block of //m// cells will contain an electron if the bit is 1, or nothing if the bit is 0. Take a look to the next picture. The same signal (11101) is represented using size 4, 6, 7 and 8:
